<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the application from an initial prototype with mock data to a fully integrated full-stack application. The development followed a structured approach: first, a functional frontend with mock data to validate the UI/UX and core flows, followed by backend implementation, database seeding, and integration. The AI engineer has adhered to the specified environment setup and development workflow, including proper use of environment variables and API routing. Crucially, backend testing has been completed successfully, and the engineer is now awaiting user confirmation to proceed with frontend testing. This systematic approach ensures robust development and testing.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a totem application for a private community hospital where patients check in. The application needs two main buttons: Ya tengo turno (I have an appointment) and Otras gestiones (Other services).
For Ya tengo turno:
1.  Prompt for a document number.
2.  Display patient's name, last name, assigned doctor, appointment time, and floor.
3.  A Confirmar (Confirm) button.
For Otras gestiones:
1.  Prompt for a document number.
2.  Display a submenu with four buttons for secretariats: secretaria PB (Ground Floor), secretaria PP (First Floor), secretaria 2P (Second Floor), and secretaria 3P (Third Floor).
After either process:
1.  Display a message: Aguarde en [corresponding floor] tome asiento y espere el llamado de la secretaria (Please wait on [corresponding floor], take a seat, and await the secretary's call).

The AI engineer has implemented these features by first creating a complete frontend experience with mock data, then building a FastAPI backend with MongoDB to handle patient and service data. The application now fully integrates the frontend with the real backend, supports patient lookups, appointment confirmation, and navigation to various secretariats, culminating in the final waiting message based on real data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed the backend development and integration with the frontend. This included:
1.  **Backend Implementation**: New FastAPI routes, MongoDB models (), database connection (), and a seeding script () were created.
2.  **Data Seeding**: The  script was executed, successfully populating the MongoDB with 8 test patients, confirming the database setup.
3.  **Frontend Integration**:  and a new  service file were updated in the frontend to switch from mock data to real API calls to the backend.
4.  **Mock Data Removal**: The  file was deleted.
5.  **Service Restart**: Both backend and frontend services were restarted via supervisor to apply changes.
6.  **Backend Testing**: The  file was updated, and the  agent was invoked. The agent reported successful comprehensive integration testing, indicating all backend endpoints (including patient lookups, appointment confirmations, and other services flows) are functioning correctly.
The current state is that the backend is fully functional and tested, integrated with the frontend, and the AI engineer is now awaiting user confirmation to initiate automated frontend testing.
